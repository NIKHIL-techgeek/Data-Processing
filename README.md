# Data-Processing
This repository hosts a Python-based application designed to streamline the processing of communication reports. Utilizing a simple GUI interface built with Tkinter, users can select and transform CSV files related to call, email, or live chat reports. The tool efficiently cleans data, applies specific transformations such as removing anonymous entries, extracting relevant user details, and standardizing formats across different report types. Finally, the transformed reports are saved back to disk, ready for further analysis or archiving. Perfect for handling customer communication data in a standardized way, this tool helps in maintaining data accuracy and usability with minimal effort.
